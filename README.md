## About This Project

<b>Hey there! In our previous article, we set up role-based authentication using Laravel's multi-authentication feature with middleware. However, for larger applications, simply assigning roles to control access to routes isn't always enough. We also need to manage access at a more detailed level, possibly even down to specific UI components. Sometimes, users may need more than one role and specific access to certain actions rather than all actions for a particular route. For instance, a route might include actions like Create, Store, Show, Edit, Update, and Destroy. Handling multiple roles and controlling access to specific actions requires some extra work.
